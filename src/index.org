spent with my friends and family, or working on whatever project I'm
caught up in at any given moment.

*** Static Web Development / CIS 170
**** /Spring 2024/
- [[./CIS-170/Project%201/][Project 1@@html:<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i>@@]] :: A
  single-page static website meant to demonstrate my understanding of
  HTML.
- [[./CIS-170/Project%202/kothman.2a.html][Project 2 (a)@@html:<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i>@@]] :: This
  was the first project of a two part assignment where we used tables
  to format static information on a web page.
- [[./CIS-170/Project%202/kothman.2b.html][Project 2 (b)@@html:<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i>@@]] :: In
  part two, I used a table to showcase my experience processing animal
  bones through decomposition, cleaning, and whitening.
- [[./CIS-170/Project%203/][Project 3@@html:<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i>@@]] :: For
  our form assignment, I created a spammy (but somewhat well-styled)
  form that pressures the user to fill it out as quickly as possible,
  while also providing a mildly annoying user experience. I spent
  extra time working on CSS tweaks, and implementing a countdown timer
  in JavaScript.
- [[./CIS-170/Project%204/][Project 4@@html:<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i>@@]] :: The
  goal for our final web page was to create a portfolio site with
  mobile-responsiveness at the forefront. I enjoyed being somewhat
  meticulous with crafting my CSS especially, including the use of
  @media queries. It wasn't until working on this page you're
  currently reading that I figured out how to use @container queries
  for more sensible mobile breakpoints.
