** Or, How I produce a PDF and webpage from a single text file.
Have you ever thought to yourself, "I wish there was a more
complicated way to make a resume"?

Jokes aside, I recently decided to streamline the creation of my
website and resume into a single workflow. Using Emacs, Org-Mode, and
LaTex, I can store and edit my information in Org files (a note-taking format
for text files) which then get automatically published upon saving.
